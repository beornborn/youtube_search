test task

Hi Rami

Please, take a look.

```
npm install
npm start
localhost:8080
```

I spent about 3 hours on this task including environment setup.
Want to notice, that I can learn very fast and utilize obtained knowledge immediately, because when I begin I barely remembered something about React
